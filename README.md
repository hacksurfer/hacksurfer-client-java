HackSurfer Java Client
======================

This repository contains sample code snippets to demonstrate the basic API interactions available from [HackSurfer's API](http://api.hacksurfer.com/).  These snippets should serve as an example only for the basic API functions, and do not provide additional functionality that will be crucial to the success of your application ( e.g. reconnect logic, complying with rate limits, etc. ).

Usage
=====

The examples can be built with [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) and run with [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).  The dependent libraries were chosen for convience sake; depending on your needs any combination of http client and deserialization libraries can be leveraged.

HackSurfer
==========

[HackSurfer](http://www.hacksurfer.com/) is several things at once. At its core, HackSurfer is designed to enable better awareness of cybercrime threats to business through data analysis, info sharing and collaboration. To do this, we bring together open, cyber-focused data journalism, expert analysis, social media and facts & figures around who's doing what to who, how are they doing it and what's happening as a result. Our main focus is helping targeted businesses stay on top of what's a threat, how to recognize it and how it affects their bottom lines.
